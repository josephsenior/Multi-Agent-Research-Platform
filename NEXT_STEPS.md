# Next Steps for Multi-Agent Research Platform

## Immediate Priorities (This Week)

### 1. Test and Verify
- [ ] Add OpenAI API key to `.env` file
- [ ] Run the application: `streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py`
- [ ] Test with sample research queries
- [ ] Upload test PDF documents
- [ ] Verify all agents work correctly
- [ ] Fix any bugs or issues found

### 2. Enhance GitHub Repository
- [ ] Add repository description: "A production-ready research platform where specialized AI agents collaborate to conduct comprehensive research, verify facts, and generate high-quality reports with citations."
- [ ] Add topics: `multi-agent`, `ai`, `research`, `langchain`, `streamlit`, `rag`, `agentic-ai`, `python`
- [ ] Add demo screenshots or GIF
- [ ] Consider adding badges (build status, license, etc.)

### 3. Deploy the Application
- [ ] Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (free, easiest option)
  - Connect GitHub repository
  - Set environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
  - Test deployed version
- [ ] Or deploy to Railway/Render for production use
- [ ] Update README with deployment link

## Short-Term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

### 4. Create Demo Materials
- [ ] Record a 2-3 minute demo video
- [ ] Take screenshots of key features
- [ ] Write a blog post or LinkedIn post about the project
- [ ] Create a project showcase page

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests for agents
- [ ] Add integration tests for workflow
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging
- [ ] Add type hints where missing
- [ ] Document complex functions

## Medium-Term Enhancements (Next Month)

### 6. Feature Additions
- [ ] Add support for Word documents (.docx)
- [ ] Add support for Markdown files
- [ ] Implement database for sessions (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Add user authentication (if multi-user)
- [ ] Add export to PDF format
- [ ] Add more citation formats

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated queries
- [ ] Add async processing for parallel agent execution
- [ ] Optimize RAG retrieval performance
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Create video tutorials
- [ ] Write developer guide
- [ ] Add more usage examples

## Long-Term Vision

### 9. Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Research templates
- [ ] Collaborative features (share sessions)
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Integration with academic databases (ArXiv, PubMed)
- [ ] Custom agent configurations

### 10. Production Readiness
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add comprehensive error recovery
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security audit

## Notes

- Focus on what adds the most value for portfolio/recruiters
- Prioritize working demos over perfect code
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Keep the codebase maintainable
